# HCL Domino C API Documentation

The HCL C API for Notes/Domino is a set of subroutines and data structures that allows you to write programs that access Domino databases. The C API subroutines are written in C and you call them from C programs.

With the HCL C API for Notes/Domino, you can write programs that perform a significant subset of the operations available through the Notes user interface and some operations that are not available through the user interface.
