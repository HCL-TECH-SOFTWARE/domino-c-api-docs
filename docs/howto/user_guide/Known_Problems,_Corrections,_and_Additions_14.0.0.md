##### Chapter 0-3
##### Known Problems, Corrections, and Additions 14.0.0

<b><font size="5" color="#000080">Introduction</font></b><br>
<br>
This chapter lists known problems and last-minute corrections and additions.<br>
<br>
The following problems exist in HCL Notes/Domino 14.0.0 for all platforms. These problems are visible during C API function calls. They are not problems with the HCL C API Toolkit for Domino and Notes itself but with the underlying Domino and Notes core routines that implement C API functions.<br>
<br>
Future releases of Domino and Notes may fix these problems. When they are fixed (and you install the new version of Domino or Notes) your C API programs will automatically receive the fixes. You will not have to recompile your C API applications, since C API programs link to the Domino or Notes core routines at run time.<br>
