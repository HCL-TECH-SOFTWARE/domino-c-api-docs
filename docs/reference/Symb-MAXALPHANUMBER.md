**Description :**
This symbol defines the maximum length of a character string that represents a 
number.  By declaring a character array of size MAXALPHANUMBER, callers of 
ConvertTextToFLOAT() or ConvertFLOATToText() are assured that the array will be 
large enough to hold the worst-case (largest) NUMBER character string.
