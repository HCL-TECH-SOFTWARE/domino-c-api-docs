**Description :**

These are the offsets within PKG_NETDRVLCL status codes used for local network 
drivers.  On Unix, since tcp is compiled into Domino, their strings must have 
unique IDs.  There is a separate package for all drivers which are optional and 
each optional driver package has its own offsets for first string.
