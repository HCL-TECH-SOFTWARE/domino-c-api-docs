**Description :**

These values define the options used when creating a full text index for a 
database.  These options may be combined by bitwise OR-ing them together.  
However, FT_INDEX_AUTOOPTIONS will ignore all other indexing options and 
therefore should not be OR-ed with any of the other indexing options.
