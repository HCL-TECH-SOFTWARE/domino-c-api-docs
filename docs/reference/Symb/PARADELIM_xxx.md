**Description :**

WORD flag used as 5th argument to ConvertItemToCompositeExt.  During conversion 
of plain LMBCS text or an existing TYPE_TEXT item to a TYPE_COMPOSITE item, the 
location of logical paragraphs must be determined and their presentation 
preserved by building the appropriate Composite Data records into the converted 
item.  The Notes Workstation application uses this information to correctly 
present the Rich Text body to the user.
