**Symbolic Values :**



**Description :**

NULLBLOCK is used to define a non-existent block.  There is no need for an API application to use this;  API applications access this data at the BLOCKID level.  NULLBLOCK should be considered a lower level data type from which ISNULLBLOCKID is abstracted.
