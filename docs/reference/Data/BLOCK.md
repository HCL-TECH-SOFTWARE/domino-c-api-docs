**Description :**

Type BLOCK is used to specify a particular memory block that is contained 
within a pool of blocks (BLOCKID structure).  API users should consider it a 
basic data entity from which the BLOCKID structure is built.  There is no need 
for API users to use a BLOCK data item directly; there are API macros provided 
that abstract the necessary operations to the BLOCKID level.
